                            <p>This was an extremely fun project to work on and it was a joy working with all the people involved.
                                From the designers to UX and backend engineers. This project was done while working for IBM
                                GreenHat. The GreenHat SaaS project is built with AngularJS, which did not take too long
                                to learn, as I was working on smaller components within the project for a few weeks.</p>
                            <p>The project required a scatter plot that would dynamically update based on data received via
                                a RESTful API. We did have a designer to work with us for the project's duration, and I found
                                working with a designer quite fun and helpful. It felt more like a collabaration than people
                                arguing, and the design input was appreciated from my end.
                            </p>
                            <p>I'll briefly go over some of the challenges and processes involved in this project and what we
                                accomplished.

                            <h3>Charting Libraries</h3>
                            <p>After some initial research, we settled on c3.js as a charting library as it had the smallest learning curve, and it is based on d3. 
                                Once the first prototype was produced however, we realized that c3 was not as dynamic and flexible as we required it to be.
                                Which led to me starting work on the beast that is d3.js.  While daunting and scary at first, after playing around with it for
                                a few days, I was able to produce a somewhat decent scatter plot.  The learning curve was quite steep, but it also allowed you to tweak 
                                all the minute details, and customize it to your hearts desire.  One of the most time consuming parts however, was mapping the data received
                                from the RESTful service to a d3 readable format.  It did not help that the data was dynamic and constantly updated.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <h3>Summary</h3>
                            <p>There was never a dull moment during the project and I enjoyed the entire process.  I got to try out a few new libraries, which is always
                                exciting, and I do think that the d3 skills are useful, and it is something I would enjoy working with again.  The scatter plot turned out to be quite 
                                responsive, interactive (zoomable, pannable), and I'm quite happy with the outcome of it.

                            <p>An enjoyable project to work on as it involved working with a lot of different new Front-End technologies.
                                Worked closely with the backend engineer that developed the RESTful services and C# models.  One of my first forays developing
                                with ASP.NET MVC4 and Razor Views.
                            </p>
                            <p>The requirement from the product manager was a blog which would drive more traffic to the site, and increase our SEO rating.
                                The blogs would be created via a CMS tool that would only be accessible by a few selected users.  We were given static images 
                                as a guideline for how the blog should look like, and we had full reign over how the CMS would look like.

                                                    <p>I have been involved in Front-End Development for many years now and
                                                        love the area. Front-End is extremely fast paced, the technology
                                                        and ideas are evolving constantly. This suits my personality as I'm
                                                        constantly looking for new challenges and to try new things. I think
                                                        a good User Interface is obvious, but tricky to describe and therefore
                                                        to design, and that’s where I come in.
