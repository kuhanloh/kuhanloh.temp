                            <p>This was an extremely fun project to work on and it was a joy working with all the people involved.
                                From the designers to UX and backend engineers. This project was done while working for IBM
                                GreenHat. The GreenHat SaaS project is built with AngularJS, which did not take too long
                                to learn, as I was working on smaller components within the project for a few weeks.</p>
                            <p>The project required a scatter plot that would dynamically update based on data received via
                                a RESTful API. We did have a designer to work with us for the project's duration, and I found
                                working with a designer quite fun and helpful. It felt more like a collabaration than people
                                arguing, and the design input was appreciated from my end.
                            </p>
                            <p>I'll briefly go over some of the challenges and processes involved in this project and what we
                                accomplished.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Charting Libraries</h3>
                            <p>After some initial research, we settled on c3.js as a charting library as it had the smallest learning curve, and it is based on d3. 
                                Once the first prototype was produced however, we realized that c3 was not as dynamic and flexible as we required it to be.
                                Which led to me starting work on the beast that is d3.js.  While daunting and scary at first, after playing around with it for
                                a few days, I was able to produce a somewhat decent scatter plot.  The learning curve was quite steep, but it also allowed you to tweak 
                                all the minute details, and customize it to your hearts desire.  One of the most time consuming parts however, was mapping the data received
                                from the RESTful service to a d3 readable format.  It did not help that the data was dynamic and constantly updated.

                            <h3>Summary</h3>
                            <p>There was never a dull moment during the project and I enjoyed the entire process.  I got to try out a few new libraries, which is always
                                exciting, and I do think that the d3 skills are useful, and it is something I would enjoy working with again.  The scatter plot turned out to be quite 
                                responsive, interactive (zoomable, pannable), and I'm quite happy with the outcome of it.

                            <p>An enjoyable project to work on as it involved working with a lot of different new Front-End technologies.
                                Worked closely with the backend engineer that developed the RESTful services and C# models.  One of my first forays developing
                                with ASP.NET MVC4 and Razor Views.
                            </p>
                            <p>The requirement from the product manager was a blog which would drive more traffic to the site, and increase our SEO rating.
                                The blogs would be created via a CMS tool that would only be accessible by a few selected users.  We were given static images 
                                as a guideline for how the blog should look like, and we had full reign over how the CMS would look like.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="single_about_area fadeInUp wow animated" data-wow-duration=".5s" data-wow-delay="1.5s" style="visibility: visible; animation-duration: 0.5s; animation-delay: 1.5s; animation-name: fadeInUp;">
                            <h3>Technologies</h3>
                            <p>Since this was technically a new project with no constraints, we could be using any of the newer technologies without any major drawbacks.  On one iteration, we tried out
                                ReactJS due to the amount of praise it has been gaining in the Front-End community. It was a good learning experience and quite easy to work with, however 
                                it still required quite few additional components to fully function.  Since most of our stuff runs on ASP.net, we decided that ReactJS did not fully meet all our criterias.
                                Enter Angular 2.  None of my previous experience with Angular 1 mattered here.  It is an entirely new framework that is heavily component based.  Working with it, it
                                felt a lot cleaner, and most of the things did make sense.  Working with the Inputs and Output Emitters was a blessing over the old Scopes.  Observables were also
                                quite easy to pick up and most of these things worked out of the box, which is why we decided to stick with Angular 2 for the Blog CMS.  We also initially had SystemJS as a module
                                loader, however after a few issues with it, we decided to switch to Webpack, as it could Uglify, Minify, did not require Gulp, and it was a lot easier to set up the app modules.  
                                As for the actual blog view, we use a Razor view to generate the initial 5 blogs, then implemented our own version of infinite scroll with jQuery to dynamically load the other entries.  
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <h3>Summary</h3>
                            <p>Got to try out so many things and make so many different decisions regarding the Front-End side of this project.  It was exiciting and stressful at times, and there's currently way too
                                much out there to choose from.  I think Angular 2 was a pretty decent choice for certain parts of the project, but there's always a trade off with these Frameworks.  Is it worth the learning
                                period and messing about just to get things right?  If your current technologies still work and you're constrained for time, is it worth investing the resources into something
                                new that is barely an improvement over what you have?  The initial plan was to render the blogs with ReactJS, but the trade off was not worth it to us.  Did we make the right choice?
                                From the result of our product and time spent, I think we did.

                                                    <p>I have been involved in Front-End Development for many years now and
                                                        love the area. Front-End is extremely fast paced, the technology
                                                        and ideas are evolving constantly. This suits my personality as I'm
                                                        constantly looking for new challenges and to try new things. I think
                                                        a good User Interface is obvious, but tricky to describe and therefore
                                                        to design, and that’s where I come in.
